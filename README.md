# kyprimary
A landing page for Kentucky citizens to learn how and where to vote in the 2016 Kentucky Primary Election

# What We Need:

* ~~Landing Page~~
* ~~UX Design~~
* ~~Good graphics~~
* ~~Polling places~~
*   ~~Where to find your polling place?~~ [see here](https://vrsws.sos.ky.gov/vic/)
* ~~Polling Captain Data~~
* ~~Secondary contact for polling location~~
*   ~~Democratic County Party Chairs~~ [see here](http://kydemocrat.com/county_parties)
* ~~Legality of pop-up polling places~~ (accommodate for voter desert, parking lots)(300 feet of any entrance)[see here](https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files/2013/12/state-laws-polling-place-electioneering-102912.pdf)

* ~~Absentee Voter deadlines and how-to's~~
* iCal, Google Cal and Outlook(maybe?) calendar saves for deadlines
* Social Media sharing to work
* ~~Add sections for non-presidential candidates from both parties: US Senate, US House, KY Senate, KY House~~
* Relocate the "D" Democratic logo to the Presidential section and make it pretty somehow
* Reconsider the page header now that our lovely graphic doesn't apply to both parties :sob:
* How to present the right identification the first time (what IDs are acceptable in Kentucky?)
